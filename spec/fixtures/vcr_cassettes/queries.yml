        \nBefore a request is sent to the MIS, we carry out a number of validations
        to ensure that you have made a valid request.\n\nDue to the asynchronous nature
        of the request we perform the validation in 2 tiers. The first tier validates
        against information we already have (student/structural), the 2nd tier validates
        against existing attendance data which we need a valid cache for so may need
        to make a request to the school before executing the validations. \n\nTier
        1 validation failures will be responded immediately and we will not queue
        a writeback request. \n\nTier 2 validations will be performed asynchronously
        and cause a failed callback (**XodCompleted=False**) if they do not pass.\n\n>

        on Completion {#Callback}\nRequests using this endpoint must provide a call
        back object so the API can tell the caller the result of the request.\n\nWriteback
        requests on using this endpoint will automatically retry the call to the school
        MIS every 5 minutes for the period of 1 hour if we are unable to connect successfully
        to the school agent. If we are unable to connect after 1 hour we will respond
        with **XodCompleted=False** and an appropriate error message to indicate the
        communications issue.\n\nThe example JSON in the sandbox is sending a callback

        response will look like:\n\n> * **Callback URL example:** https://xporter.groupcall.com/TryIt/Callback/\n\nWe

        on Completion {#Callback}\n\nBy specifying a callback URL in the POST data,
        you will let XporterOnDemand know that you would like us to call you back
        when the writeback has completed so you don''t have to wait around for it
        to finish.\n\nThe example JSON in the sandbox is sending a callback to our
        URL which you can open and have a look at so you can see what it will look
        like:\n\n> * **Callback URL example:** https://xportertesting.groupcall.com/TryIt/Callback/\n\n\nWe
        will call you back on your URL with the **id** and **estab** parameters that
        you passed in the writeback POST. We will also include an additional parameter
        **XodCompleted** with a value of **True** or **False** which determines the
        success or failure of the writeback attempt.\n\nWhen an Behaviour Conduct
        is successfully written back, we will also include POST body data with the
        Id of the event that was created in the MIS so you can reconcile a successful
        writeback being made.\n\nThe JSON we will return to you will look similar
        to the below example:\n\n    {\n\t    \"result\":[\n\t\t    { \n\t\t\t    \"IncidentId\":1,\n\t\t\t    \"ActualId\":1811\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n\n>
        **IncidentId:** The incremental Id of the conduct record that was specified
        in the JSON you POSTed\n> **ActualId:** The MIS Id of the record that was
        created for that conduct record\n\n\n[Return to top](#Header)\n***","Query":"","Options":"","Parameters":"","Published":true,"PageSize":0},{"Version":"1","Id":"POST.LessonAttendance","Method":"POST","Scope":"WritebackAttendance","Path":"/api/v1/Attendance/{estab}/","Description":"##

        for more than one date, the API will return a validation error and will not
        attempt to send the information to the MIS.\n\nWe will validate your writeback
        POST before we send to the school to ensure that the information provided
        contain valid information (student Ids, correct marks etc). If there is an
        error, we will fail the request and provide you an error message detailing
        the issue.\n\n> **SIMS Note:** All write backs are treated as atomic. If your
        request passes validate, but for some reason does not complete successfully
        at SIMS, all records contained within the request can be considered to have
        failed.\n> \n> * We would consider this a very rare scenario so if you do

        so only relevant information is retrieved.\n\nBy default, this endpoint returns
        **Aspects** and **ResultSets**. By setting the options below, you can expand
        this to include more detailed structure information.","Documentation":"##Endpoint
        Description {#Header}\nThe assessment structure endpoint provides you with
        the components that make up a given school''s assessment setup in their MIS.
        \n\nAs there can be hundreds of thousands of results stored for a single school,
        it is important to be able to collect just the specific result information
        you need. Using the data from this endpoint, you could provide your end user
        with a choice of which assessment aspects, templates or marksheets to collect
        results for, meaning you don''t overload your platform with unnecessary information.\n\n###Usage\n\nIf
        your intention is to simply display results for particular assessments in
        your application, then you likely just need to identify the **Aspects** that
        are relevant to the school so you can request only the Results that you need.\n\nThe
        simplest way to achieve this is for the school to select the **Templates**
        (Bulk / Fewer: collections of assessments defined by the school for a particular
        purpose) or the **Aspects** (Granular / Many: the individual specific assessments)
        that they know are the correct ones they wish to display.\n\n* **Example:**
        School wishes to display \"Target\" and \"Working At\" values for students\n\t*
        School selects templates that contain the assessments (**Aspects**) they require
        eg \"English Assessment Y9\", \"Maths Assessment Y7\"\n\t* Your application
        then can request Results for the **Template** IDs that were selected and the
        XporterOnDemand API will return Results for all of the assessments (**Aspects**)
        that are contained in the template.\n\t* You may receive multiple Results
        for each **Aspect**. This will be because the Results are assigned to **ResultSets**
        which define a particular reporting period.\n\t* You would expect the received
        **Aspects** to relate to \"Target\" or \"Working At\" although each school''s
        naming conventions will differ\n\n> **Note:** Some schools may flip the above
        model and use **ResultSets** to define things like \"Target\" and \"Working
        At\" for a single **Aspect**, rather than separate **Aspects** and using **ResultSets**
        to define time periods.\n\nBy default, this endpoint returns **Aspects** and
        **ResultSets**. By setting the options below, you can expand this to include
        more detailed structure information.\n\nAssessmentStructure is included in
        the **School** consent scope as it provide organisational and structural information
        for the establishment.\n\n####Quick Links \n- [Options](#Options)\n- [Related
